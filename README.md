# MonetaryCoin White-Paper 

## The Monetary Protocol

MonetaryCoin is compliant with ERC-20 (EIP-20) and has three key features and a supporting foundation.

* First, coins are forged via a **Proof-of-Stake** approach.

* Second, stakeholders may **elect to add** (and later delete) personal information to satisfy anti-money laundering, know-your-customer regulations.

* Third, once fully distributed, the rate of change in the supply of a MonetaryCoin parallels the **rate of change in the GDP** of a subject country (monetarism).

Monetarismâ€™s limitations are well understood, and today most central bankers instead apply a variety of tools in pursuit of an inflation target, rather than the simplified money target only. 

The coin serves as a simplified alternative to domestic fiat so that residents may select away from the short-run decisions of their central bank while still retaining money tethered to the long-run progress of the economy. Because the starting number of coins is capped at not more than 1% of the current M2 per country, MonetaryCoin is designed as a value-added companion to an existing money supply, not a replacement.
